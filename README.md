## How to Use It

- Open the **Alma Letters Editor**
- After a few seconds, the editor will change to a new editor that allows better coding control
- Look for the new toolbar with:
  - `Update Preview` – apply XSL changes and update the letter preview window.
  - `Detach Preview` – open the letter preview in a separate window and extend code boxes to fill the page. Makes editing easier.
  - `Condition Builder` – Helps with crafting the XSL-specific coding for adding information from the XML to your letter.

The script replaces Alma’s old editor with a modern, user-friendly version and adds visual tools to help build advanced logic with ease.

---

## Troubleshooting

If nothing happens:

- Make sure Tampermonkey is installed and **enabled**
- Make sure the script is **installed** and **enabled**
- Refresh the Alma Letters Editor page. Sometimes, due to how Alma loads, Tampermonkey doesn't know that you are on the proper page.

If the issue continues, contact your Alma system administrator or [open an issue](https://github.com/PASCAL-SC/alma-letter-editor-plus/issues).
